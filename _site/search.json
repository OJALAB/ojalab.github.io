On the one hand, increasing non-response and under-reporting in business sample surveys introduce bias in job vacancy estimates and the limited scope of surveys does not allow to provide estimates of skills and competencies demand or to cover all types of contracts (e.g. contract agreement, B2B). On the other hand, administrative data and the Internet cover thousands of job ads full of valuable information but direct usage of these sources for statistics is limited by the coverage and selection error. While there are plenty of applications of job ads for describing demand, mismatch or matching little is done in order to correct for measurement error or non-representativeness. Thus, results based on these studies may provide wrong recommendations for the policymakers.\nTherefore, this project aims to tackle these problems using modern statistical methods and propagate uncertainty in macroeconomic analysis and policy guidance. The main objective of the project is to develop new methods to measure the size and characteristics of the job vacancies (including non-standard and flexible work contracts) based on the survey, online and administrative data, and apply it to analyse the short-run and long-run developments of the vacancy market in Poland and the matching technology. To fulfil the main objective we identify five specific objectives.\nFirstly, we will propose a new approach to estimate the number of vacancies, which is based solely on online and administrative data using capture-recapture and latent class analysis methods. To fill this task we will use data from public employment offices and several online services. These data require cleaning and deduplication procedures that we plan to develop during the project. Classification algorithms will be developed to identify employers and job characteristics (e.g. occupation, skills, type of contract).\nSecondly, we will correct for non-representativeness of big data sources by usage of the Demand for Labour survey (Statistics Poland). To tackle this problem we will use data integration methods and extend them for measurement error as all variables from job ads will be obtained from classification algorithms. In additiion, results from task will be used to correct survey weights. In this task, we will closely work with an expert from the North Carolina State University, USA.\nThirdly, we will use results from task 1 & 2 to estimate the size and structure of demand for skills. This will supply unique variables that cannot be obtained in surveys, such as skills, contract types or contract mode (remote, hybrid, mobile, traditional). Thanks to this we will analyse the skill evolution both between occupations and within them. This will show the evolution of skill reqirements and will help anticipate skill needs.\nFourthly, as we have access to data before the COVID-19 pandemic and migration inflow of Ukrainians we will verify hypotheses about the structural change in the labour market. COVID-19 recession sped up the process of labour market transformation – online work and more flexible work contracts, such as B2B. Such contracts are not included in employment estimates in the official statistics, while they have a profound effect on the labour market. The inflow of migrants may be an opportunity for firms, but to unknown extent. We will test and model the structural change.\nFinally, thanks to unique data on job offers and job seekers’ behaviour we will analyse the search and matching process in more detail than it has been done before. In this task, we will use and merge rich unit-level data on the unemployed and job offers from public employment offices, thanks to the information on the matches between them, that we already possess. It will enable to test influence of requirements from individual job offers and histories of unemployed persons on job search.\nWe plan to work according to the open science principles, i.e. we plan to use and develop open-source software, make the algorithms and data available to the public and present the work in open access journals.\nWe believe that the project will have an impact not only on official statistics through developing new methods for non-probability samples and integration of statistical and non-statistical sources but also on labour market economics and policy, providing new, in-depth, and reliable information about the vacancy market."
